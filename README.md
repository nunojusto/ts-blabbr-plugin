# Blabbr

A Lua plugin for Teamspeak 3 that will show the name of the person speaking on the chat channel.

## Getting Started

Download this repository. You only need the `blabbr` directory containing the Lua scripts.

These instructions have been tested on Windows 10. The plugin should work on Linux but the plugins directory will be in a different location.

## Prerequisites

You need to install the Lua plugin in Teamspeak before using this code.

This can be installed from the application Tools menu > Options > Addons > Browse online.

Type `lua` in the search field to find the lua plugin. Click on this and then click on the Install button. Once installed, make sure the Lua plugin is enabled and click Reload.

Verify that the following directory exists (replace `your-user-name` with your actual user name on Windows):

`C:\Users\your-user-name\AppData\Roaming\TS3Client\plugins\lua_plugin`

(On Linux it's: ~/.ts3client/plugins/lua_plugin)

It should have some files in it from the installation of the Lua plugin. If you don't see any files there, go back to Lua Plugin > Settings and try ticking and unticking the testmodule.

## Installing

Copy the `blabbr` directory containing the Lua scripts to the lua_plugin directory.
